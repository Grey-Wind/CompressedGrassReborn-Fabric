## About

The mod remade Compressed Grass made by GreyWind updates the original 1.7.10 version of the mod to 1.16.5. I will gradually improve and add the content that the original author did not add before.

We now have many things, such as armors, tools, entities and more other interesting and amazing things.

## Important Schedule

Restart all the project(2022/10/14)——I spend 8 hours to try to build it.

Build successful(2022/10/15)——I use the old build successful project and change its version.

## Sponsorship and Cooperation(something incidental)

All the things about sponsorship and cooperation please see the readme in the forge version.

Most of the thinking in this mod come from GreyWind. I welcome input from anyone.

I will create all the things I can make or I have time to study how to make it.
